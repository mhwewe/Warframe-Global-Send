Have you ever been waiting for people to join your "H [Axi A5 Relic] Rad 3/4" and you realise no one is coming? well ofc you have.

What you might or might not have known is that the Recruting chat is region based and you can change your region to a diffrent one and paste "H [Axi A5 Relic] Rad 3/4" over there too, but the problem is that there are 6 regions and changing and pasting is annoying

So I made an app that does that for you, it copies what is in ur clipboard(Ctrl + C) and pastes in the chat of every region and now you dont even know what to do with the amount of players messaging you "inv".

If anyone can find a way to make this into a .exe file PLEASE open an issue or message me on discord and teach me your ways: mhwewe

# To install do this:

### - Install python https://www.python.org/downloads/
### - Download the latest release of my program https://github.com/mhwewe/Warframe-Global-Send/releases
### - Extract the zip and run run.bat, wait for the packages to install for the first time
### - After it installs everything go to Warframe -> Options -> System and set the region to North America
### - copy something like "H [Axi A5 Relic] Rad 3/4" and go to your orbiter and press the arrow up key(exit the chat and options until you can move your camera)
### - and now dont touch anything until it finishes (:
### - after the first launch if you want the app to start faster you can edit run.bat and delete the first line "pip install ..."

If you encountered any problems please make sure to open an issue or message me on discord: mhwewe
